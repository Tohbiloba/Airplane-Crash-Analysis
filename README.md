# Background

In fulfilment of the 30DaysofLearning project the second project worked on is the Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since 1908 to 2019.

The analysis answered questions such as:

* number of fatality recorded across the years
* number of fatality recorded across the 1 months
* number of fatality recorded by route and aircraft type
* number of fatality recorded by period of the day

# Data Collection

The data was provided by the 30DaysOfLearning instructors in a GitHub folder, the origin of the dataset can be further traced to Kaggle. The dataset can also be gotten [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908).

# Data Preparation

Microsoft Excel was used to take a brief look at the dataset to understand and determine the insights to derive from the data.

Further analysis and visualization was carried out in Power BI.

A calendar table was created which served as the date table for the analysis.

* The period of the day was derived using conditional formatting in power query. This was done to determine the period of the day with high fatality rate.

# Data Visualization and Insights

* Total number of people aboard is 102,067 out of which 28,017 (27.45%) survived the crash while 74,050 (72.55%) died from the crash.

Some of the reasons that could lead to aviation crash include:

* Most of the errors could be as a result of human mistakes ranging from the Pilot’s error, Crew members mistakes, Traffic controller’s negligence
* Weather condition
* Negligence towards maintenance of the aircraft and some others.

Recommendation

* Human errors are fatal therefore airline operators, crew members, traffic controllers should adhere strictly to rules and regulations guiding flying an air craft so as to reduce the rate of aircraft accidents.
* Weather is also one of the factors that causes aircraft crash the weather then should be better studied so as to determine if it’s safe to fly an aircraft at the time.
